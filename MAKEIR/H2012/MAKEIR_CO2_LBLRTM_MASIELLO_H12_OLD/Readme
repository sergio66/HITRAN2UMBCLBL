we want to generate spectra using LBLRTM, for gas cell tests. In other
words we only want to give a few parameters, and get LBLRTM to output
the spectra. Can you tell me how to do that? For each gas in the cell,
the gas cell parameters will be of the following form
   pressure (mb)    partial pressure (mb)     temperature (K)   amount (mol/cm2)

According to my experience, you may want to change the record 2.1
(including 2.1.1, 2.1.2, and 2.1.3) in TAPE5.

Before you change record 2.1, you should firstly change record 1.2 to the form like this:

 HI=1 F4=1 CN=5 AE=0 EM=0 SC=0 FI=0 PL=0 TS=0 AM=0 MG=1 LA=0 OD=1 XS=0   00   00

MG = 1   OD on separate files
EM = 0   no emission, od only
AM = 0 means you will provide layer averaged gas properties in record
2.1 and the LBLRTM won’t call the internal lblatm subroutine to handle
this.

After that, you need to provide the layer averaged gas properties in record 2.1.1~2.1.3

For example, you want have a cell only have two gases N2 and CO2. The
total gas pressure is 1mb and the amount ratio of N2 to CO2 is 9. You
can use the following record 2.1

record 2.1:
 1  1    7       1.0                        2.00        1.00
first “1”: IFORM, 1 means E15.7
second “1”: number of layers, here you want to use 1
third “7”: 7 major gases are specified, which are H2O, CO2, O3, N2O, CO, CH4, and O2
“1.00 and 2.00”: observational altitude and end point altitude in km

record 2.1.1:
   1.0000000E00  297.6000              1    1.00   1.500 297.60   2.00   0.500 297.60
first “1.0000000E00 ”:  gas averaged pressure
second “297.6000”: averaged temperature
third “1”: looking down merge

“1.00   1.500 297.60   2.00   0.500 297.60”: 

layer bottom altitude (km), pressure (mb), temperature (K) and layer top altitude (km), pressure (mb), temperature (K).

Note that you can set any altitude or pressure for layer boundaries since the averaged value are provided.

record 2.1.2:
   0.0000000E00   X.XXXXXXXEXX   0.0000000E00   0.0000000E00   0.0000000E00   0.0000000E00   0.0000000E00   X.XXXXXXXEXX

Gas column densities (#molecules/cm^2) for the 7 gases and for the broadening gases.

I am not sure if these LBLRTM settings are correct but you could check the LBLRTM user guide.

Ciao Sergio,

Here I attached 5 files that I use to prepare lblrtm input files
(TAPE5) and to read lblrtm output files (TAPE12 and OD_....).

wt5_new.m.
lbl_read_dbl.m
odread.m
tape7_read.m
wt5l.m

The functions have headers that I hope help you for their use.

wt5_new.m. Is a matlab function that write (LEVELS) TAPE5 file for the newest
           version of lblrtm (from v10 to the current v12.2).  As you can read in
           the function comment this script was first prepared by Dave, then I
           modified according my issues and following changes in LBLRTM.

lbl_read_dbl.m Reads double precision READIANCE/TRANSMISSION output files (TAPE12), even in
               this case the original scripts was prepared by Dave.

odread.m is similar to lbl_read_dbl.m but it reads double precision
         Optical Depth files (ODexact__).

tape7_read.m read TAPE7 file.

wt5l.m Prepares TAPE5 file for generation of Optical Depth. 
       This is the function I run to generate optical depth to be interpolated in our
       look-up-table database.  In doing this I work with the option LBLATM=0. 
 
       As you know when you set LBLATM=0 you must supply information on the atmosphere to the code. In this 
       script I load it from file atmos_data3. So you for sure cannot run this script without
       atmos_data3.mat. At moment I don't send you it since it is tuned on
       our pressure grid (If you need I send it!). But you can provide this
       information with your grid specification if you produce a TAPE7 file.

       My suggestion in order to have this TAPE7 file is: you first prepare
       TAPE5 file with wt5_new.m (set a short wavenumber range); then read
       TAPE7 with tape7_read.m and save the results in a equivalent
       "atmos_data3.mat" file; prepare TAPE5 file for OD with wt5l.m; finally
       read ODexact_ with odread.m.

Let me know if these help you and don't hesitate in contact me for further clarification.


Ciao Guido

Originally I did gases [1,103 .. see WV dir] and gases 3,4,5,6,9,12 but 12 takes so long I dropped it

look at set_str_unc.m .. will have to keep editing for different uncertainties
  S-/S+ = strength
  B-/B+ = broadening
  P-/P+ = pressure shift
  W-/W+ = wavenumber
  should also do R = random

then cp gN_ir_list0.txt gN_ir_list.txt    == list of gases/chunks to run, about 4000 (see loop_filelist_gN.m)

then call sergio_matlab_makegas3_42.sbatch
  you basically switch between
    running "run8" to make the ODs using
    clust_runXtopts_savegasN_file
    called by sbatch --array=1-4004%128 sergio_matlab_makegas3_42.sbatch

monitor things by using
  loop_filelist_gN_missing
when happy first call
  loop_rmerxN (to remove empty files)
  loop_filelist_gN_missing (to make a list of missing files)
  cp gN_ir_list2.txt gN_ir_list.txt

THEN run the sergio_matlab_makegas3_42.sbatch gatherer using
    clust_runXtopts_mkgNvfiles
    called by sbatch --array=3-9 sergio_matlab_makegas3_42.sbatch

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

simultaneouly in WV dir do

cp g1_ir_list_all990.txt g1_ir_list.txt
cp g103_1105_list_all990.txt g103_1105_list.txt

# run this with sbatch --array=1-990%256 --output='/dev/null' sergio_matlab_makegas1_103.sbatch
matlab -nodisplay -r "clust_runXtopts_savegas1_file; exit"
matlab -nodisplay -r "clust_runXtopts_savegas103_file; exit"

monitor things using
gas_done_already_g1_OR_g103(1,1)
gas_done_already_g1_OR_g103(103,1)

they remove empty files and produce output files which you can use
cat g1_ir_list_missing.txt g103_1105_list_missing.txt > g1_ir_list.txt
cat g1_ir_list_missing.txt g103_1105_list_missing.txt > g103_1105_list.txt

then finally run the gatherer
# for these do sbatch --array=1-90 sergio_matlab_makegas1_103.sbatch
matlab -nodisplay -r clust_runXtopts_mkg1vfiles; exit
matlab -nodisplay -r clust_runXtopts_mkg103vfiles; exit

now go to /home/sergio/HITRAN2UMBCLBL/CMPRUN
  edir (to set the input/output dir) and run the following two files
  cmprunIR_OTHERS                          (does gases 3,4,5,6,9,12)
  cmprunIR_WV_H16([1 103],605:25:2830);    (does gases 1,103)

now go to /home/sergio/HITRAN2UMBCLBL/FORTRAN/mat2for
  edit (to set the input/output dir) and run the foloowing two files
  loop_mat2forIR
  loop_mat2forIR_WV_H16

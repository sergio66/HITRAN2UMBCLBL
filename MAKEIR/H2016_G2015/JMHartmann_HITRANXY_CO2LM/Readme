Need to run executable fortran code from /asl/data/hitran/H2016/LineMix_MainCode/driver_LM_calc_CO2_modified_gascell.for
This code dumps temporary output at 0.0005 cm-1 res (raF,raVoigt,raFirst,raFull) into 
          caFname =
     $ '/asl/s1/sergio/H2016_RUN8_NIRDATABASE/IR_605_2830/g2_LM/' //
     $    'g2.dat_LM5ptbox_Mar2021_400ppm/std' // ca4 // '_2_' // ca2 // '_' // ca3

and this has to be matched by outputdir.m which sets 
     output_dir5 = '/asl/s1/sergio/H2016_RUN8_NIRDATABASE/IR_605_2830/g2_LM/g2.dat_LM5ptbox_Mar2021_400ppm/';          %% try this!

Main driver code for making the compressed database is 
  cluster_run_lm_5ptboxcar_laychunk.m
    make sure you set 
      useCO2ppm to eg 400 
    Code works by breaking the US STd profile
      /home/sergio/HITRAN2UMBCLBL/REFPROF/refproTRUE.mat
    into Toffset, with the 100 layers subdivided for running purposes into 10 sets 1-1..10,2=11-20,3=31-40 .. 10=91-100
    and so tales the temporary output from the fortran code, boxcar intergrates to 0.0025 cm-1 and then dumps the final output into 
        /asl/s1/sergio/H2016_RUN8_NIRDATABASE/IR_605_2830/g2_LM/g2.dat_LM5ptbox_Mar2021_400ppm/1
        /asl/s1/sergio/H2016_RUN8_NIRDATABASE/IR_605_2830/g2_LM/g2.dat_LM5ptbox_Mar2021_400ppm/2
        /asl/s1/sergio/H2016_RUN8_NIRDATABASE/IR_605_2830/g2_LM/g2.dat_LM5ptbox_Mar2021_400ppm/3 ...
        /asl/s1/sergio/H2016_RUN8_NIRDATABASE/IR_605_2830/g2_LM/g2.dat_LM5ptbox_Mar2021_400ppm/10 ...
    so make sure you make those 10 dirs

Main sbatch script is 
  sergio_lm_makegas2.sbatch
but best to run it using
  run_lm.sc
  where I have edited it to use
    dovers=2
    llmin=1
    llmax=10
    sbatch --array=1-990%512 sergio_lm_makegas2.sbatch $ll  
  We make 90 chunks from 605-2830 cm-1, and are 11 Toffsets per chunk .. so in each of the 10 dirs there should be 11*90 = 990 mat files  
  for a grand total of 9990 mat files

Check progress using
  quick_plot_progress_cluster_run_lm_5ptboxcar_laychunk.m
    this first looks at the individual 10 dires to see how many files have been made (should be 990 in each dir)
    and then asks user to choose one of the 10 laychunks, and goes through to load in each 25 cm-1 chunk

Put the files togther into 
        /asl/s1/sergio/H2016_RUN8_NIRDATABASE/IR_605_2830/g2_LM/g2.dat_LM5ptbox_Mar2021_400ppm/abs.dat
  using runXtopts_mkgNvfiles_10layerchunks.m
        
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Now go compress the files
  cd /home/sergio/HITRAN2UMBCLBL/CMPRUN
  edit cmprunIR_HITRAN_CO2LM.m so it points to 
    f77_LMvers = 'g2.dat_LM5ptbox_Mar2021_400ppm';   %% Mar 2021  
  mkdir /asl/s1/sergio/H2016_RUN8_NIRDATABASE/IR_605_2830/g2_LM/g2.dat_LM5ptbox_Mar2021_400ppm/kcomp
  mkdir /asl/s1/sergio/H2016_RUN8_NIRDATABASE/IR_605_2830/g2_LM/g2.dat_LM5ptbox_Mar2021_400ppm/kcomp/full

  then in matlab
    cmprunIR_HITRAN_CO2LM;  (so this is same as cmprunIR_HITRAN_CO2LM(2,605:25:2830,2016);

Now go change them to f77/f70 binary
  cd /home/sergio/HITRAN2UMBCLBL/FORTRAN/mat2for
  edit loop_mat2forIR_HITRAN_CO2LM.m
    %%% these are the 2020 tries
    gdir = ['/asl/s1/sergio/H2016_RUN8_NIRDATABASE/IR_605_2830/g2_LM/g2.dat_LM5ptbox_Mar2021_400ppm/abs.dat/full/'];
    cdir = ['/asl/s1/sergio/H2016_RUN8_NIRDATABASE/IR_605_2830/g2_LM/g2.dat_LM5ptbox_Mar2021_400ppm/kcomp/full/'];
    fdir = ['/asl/data/kcarta/H2016.ieee-le/IR605/HITRAN_LM/etc.ieee-le/Mar2021/fullCO2_400ppmv/'];

Can compare the files! use compare_CO2_LBLRTM_LM.m

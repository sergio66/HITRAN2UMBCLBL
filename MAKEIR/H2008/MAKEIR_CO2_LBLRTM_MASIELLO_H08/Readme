Ciao Sergio,

First of all, sorry for the delay I reply you.
I'm sorry about you Father (I didnâ€™t know). I understand your conflicting feeling about your mothers! 

I'm sorry also for Scott!

Coming back to the work.

Here I attached  5 files that I use to prepare lblrtm input files (TAPE5) and to read lblrtm output files (TAPE12 and OD_....).

wt5_new.m.
lbl_read_dbl.m
odread.m
tape7_read.m
wt5l.m

The functions have headers that I hope help you for their use.

wt5_new.m. Is a matlab function that write TAPE5 file for the newest version of lblrtm (from v10 to the current v12.2).
As you can read in the function comment this script was first prepared by Dave, then I modified according my issues and following changes in LBLRTM.

lbl_read_dbl.m Reads double precision output files (TAPE12), even in this case the original scripts was prepared by Dave.

odread.m  is similar to lbl_read_dbl.m but it reads double precision Optical Depth files (ODexact__).

tape7_read.m read TAPE7 file.

wt5l.m Prepares TAPE5 file for generation of Optical Depth. This is the function I run to generate optical depth to be interpolated in our look-up-table database.
In doing this I work with the option LBLATM=0. As you know when you set LBLATM=0 you must supply information on the atmosphere to the code. In this script I load it from file atmos_data3. So you for sure cannot run this script without atmos_data3.mat. At moment I don't send you it since it is tuned on our pressure grid (If you need I send it!). But you can provide this information  with your grid specification if you produce a TAPE7 file.
My suggestion in order to have this TAPE7 file is: you first prepare TAPE5 file with wt5_new.m (set a short wavenumber range); then read TAPE7 with tape7_read.m and save the results in a equivalent "atmos_data3.mat" file;  prepare TAPE5 file for OD with wt5l.m; finally read ODexact_ with odread.m.

Let me know if these help you and don't hesitate in contact me for further clarification.


Ciao Guido

GASES 3-42

Basically first edit 
   loop_filelist_gN.m to point to H2020 dirs including to write to 
   loop_filelist_gN_missing.m
       fdir = ['/asl/s1/sergio/H2020_RUN8_NIRDATABASE/IR_605_2830/g' num2str(gid) '.dat'];
then run loop_filelist_gN.m
  which generates a list of  ~20000 gas x freqchunk x 11 Toffsets to be done
  use -1 to enter gid Start/Stop = [3 49] 
     
Then edit/set dir name in freq_boundaries.m to point to H2020
  dirout = ['/asl/s1/sergio/H2020_RUN8_NIRDATABASE/IR_605_2830/g' num2str(gid) '.dat'];

And use the HPC cluster to run sergio_matlab_makegas3_42.sbatch
  sbatch --array=1-1800%128 --output='/dev/null' sergio_matlab_makegas3_42.sbatch
After that run loop_rmerxN.m to get rid of bempty files
           run loop_filelist_gN_missing.m
	   cp gN_ir_list2.txt gN_ir_list.txt; X is the number of files to be made here (cat gN_ir_list2.txt | wc -l)
           sbatch --array=1-X%128 --output='/dev/null' sergio_matlab_makegas3_42.sbatch
   and so on

sergio_matlab_makegas3_42.sbatch : calls the previous file

GASES 51-81

loop_filelist_xsecN.m

edit loop_filelist_xsecN.m : change 2012 to 2016 to 2020
  /home/sergio/SPECTRA/READ_XSEC/read_xsec.m : need to fix that so default = 2016

sergio_matlab_makegas51_81.sbatch : calls clust_runXtopts_savexsecN_file

Note : have to be careful about iSwitchXsecDataBase
  originally I used the H12 xsec database so did nothing
  then I downloaded H2016 for gases 51-63, so had     to switch to H2012 for gases 64-81
  now  I downloaded H2016 for gases 51-81, so no need to switch to H2012

PUTTING CHUNKS TOGETHER

edit that so that you run it ONCE to make /asl/s1/sergio/H2016_RUN8_NIRDATABASE/IR_605_2830/abs.dat/
then edit sergio_matlab_makegas3_42.sbatch so that you use short queue, and call it as
   sbatch --array=1-49 sergio_matlab_makegas3_42.sbatch

it should fail on three gases that are not made by clust_runXtopts_savegasN_file.m

COMPRESS
cd /home/sergio/HITRAN2UMBCLBL/CMPRUN
edit cmprunIR_OTHERS.m as needed  H2012 --> H2016 --> H2020
  cmprunIR_OTHERS(3:42,605:25:2830,2020);

CONVERT TO F77 files

then you need to get the list of files ready for kCARTA
ls -lt /asl/data/kcarta/H2020.ieee-le/IR605/hdo.ieee-le/
ls -lt /asl/data/kcarta/H2020.ieee-le/IR605/etc.ieee-le/

cd /home/sergio/KCARTA/SCRIPTS/MAKE_COMP_HTXY_PARAM_SC
edit comp_IRdatabase_H2020.sc
  edit kWaterPath
       kCO2Path
       kCOmpPath
       PARAM_HT2020/comp_ir605_2830.param
run comp_IRdatabase_H2020.sc

>>>>>>>>>>>>>
NOTE : Nov 2017 been a bit lazy with XSC gases so use this script to copy or blow away xsc files
copy_xscHT2012_to_HT2020.sc   which contains these two simple lines
  cp -a /asl/data/kcarta/H2012_IR/etc/*g[5678][123456789].dat /asl/data/kcarta/H2020.ieee-le/IR605/etc.ieee-le/.
  cp -a /asl/data/kcarta/H2012_IR/etc/*g[678][0].dat /asl/data/kcarta/H2020.ieee-le/IR605/etc.ieee-le/.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>

then with Matlab you can run eg
  compare_databases(1:81,'PARAM_HT2012/comp_ir605_2830.param','PARAM_HT2020/comp_ir605_2830.param')

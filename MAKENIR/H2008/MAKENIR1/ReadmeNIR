In the MAKENIR dir
  nir_runXtopts_savegases.sc
  calls nir_runXtopts_savegasesX.m  which loops over gases = [2:32] 
                                       for chunk 2830:3330
                                       It makes one file/gas/toffset
                                       eg std4250_4_pp.mat  pp = 1 : 11
                                       in dir ~/abscmp/absdat
nir_runXtopts_mkgXvfiles.m
  takes the 11 files per gas (for each chunk) and concats them into one file
  eg ~/abscmp/absdat/abs.dat has files g4v4250.mat,g5v4250.mat,g6v4250.mat

nir_runXtopts_savegas1 does the same for water (partial pressures)
nir_runXtopts_mkg1vfiles.m

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

cmprunNIR.m 
  makes the compressed data files 
  eg ~/abscmp/absdat/kcomp has files cg4v4250.mat,cg5v4250.mat,cg6v4250.mat

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
fortran/mat2for/mat2forNIR.m 
  %% make sure you edit fstep, and prefix for file in fname (r,v,w whatever)
fortran/mat2for/loop_mat2forNIR.m 
  converts these .mat files into .f77 files for kcarta

which together do the below for you automatically
  cd /home/sergio/abscmp/fortran/mat2for/
  gid = 4;
  vchunk = 4250;
  cdir = '/home/sergio/abscmp/absdat/kcomp/';
  fdir = '/home/sergio/abscmp/absdat/fbin/etc.ieee-le/';
  dtype = 'ieee-le';

or 

  gid = 1;
  vchunk = 4250;
  cdir = '/home/sergio/abscmp/absdat/kcomp.h2o/';
  fdir = '/home/sergio/abscmp/absdat/fbin/etc.ieee-le/';
  dtype = 'ieee-le';

   mat2forNIR(gid, vchunk, cdir, fdir, dtype)
  will make /home/sergio/abscmp/absdat/fbin/etc.ieee-le/m4250_g4.dat

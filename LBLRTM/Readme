A). TAPE5 for gasX

I changed my TAPE5 to do what you suggested, does this look correct?
(there is no WV, so turning on the self and foreign WV continuum
should not make a difference, right?

I checked the newly produced CO2 ODs against what I produced last
week, and they look very similar in the 15 um region (no N2 there),
and very small differences in the 4.3 um region. Testing BTs produced
using your suggested method of getting CO2 optical depths versus what
I did last week, shows very small differences (plot below is at 0.0025
cm-1 kCARTA resolution after averaging over the 49 regression profiles
.. differences show up in the expected N2 region)

Good.  This seems reasonable.

B) ) TAPE5 for N2

Assuming I made correct TAPE5 for "other" gases, embarrassingly I am
still having difficulty with N2 (and presumably O2). I manage to get
zeros everywhere, or no lines and significantly lower optical depths
than I expect, or no lines but ballpark ODs that I expect. Can you
take a look at one of the incarnations of TAPE5 that I made for N2
this morning, and let me know what is wrong (and also how to modify it
so I can produce O2 optical depths)?

I think there are two problems with this TAPE5.  First, there should
be 8 amounts on each line, not 7.  The 8 on the first line are for 7
molecules and the broadening gas, but after that each line is for 8.
So your attempt to use molecule 22 actually ended up using a non-zero
amount of CH3Cl (molecule 24).  Once you fix that, the N2 lines should
be as you want, with 21% of the atmosphere being a generic foreign
broadener.  However, the continuum still won’t be right since I misled
you on my last email.  The continuum code defines the N2 vmr as 1 –
X_h2o – X_o2, so this TAPE5 will think all the molecules are N2.  To
avoid this, you can move the other 21% back to O2, but take steps to
make sure that O2 does not create any OD on its own.  You can shut off
the O2 continuum by setting the O2 continuum scale factor to 0.  The
O2 lines are not as easy.  Depending on the spectral region, you may
not have any O2 lines to worry about (e.g. none between 1717 and
6256), but if you are in a region with O2 lines then the only option I
can think of is to do this run with a line parameter file having no O2
lines.  To do this, you would run lnfl to generate a TAPE3 with (say)
only N2 lines.  We can have someone here help you with that if you
want.

 Dear Sergio,

I’m glad the (dopey) LBLRTM 10 micron bug was cured by changing the
spectral region.  We’ll fix this problem in the next release.

The method we use with LBLRTM to get the optical depths only from a
single species is to run the code with gas amounts both for gasN and
"rest of gases”, but set the N2 continuum flag to 0.  (For N2 you
would just have non-zero “rest of gases”.)  I would worry a bit about
the method you used for O2 (since the N2 continuum has different
efficiency for collisions with O2 vs N2) and perhaps N2 (if you used
molecule 22 to do this).

Do you know why the two results are somewhat different in the O3
region?  There haven’t been any recent spectroscopic changes that we
know of.

Some other responses to what you wrote:
"the N2 optical depths are slightly different (guess your continuum has changed)”
- a number of years ago we added the O2 efficiency piece; other than
 that, we can’t think of anything else that changed 
"whereas our UMBC-LBL optical depths show those very weak N2 quadropole lines in
 the 2200 - 2500 cm-1 region, the ones computed using LBLRTM only
 showed the smooth continuum.”
- you should get those lines if you specify molecule 22

With respect to the fluxes/heating rates, I have concerns about your
calculations.  RRTM has been compared quite extensively with LBLRTM
(see http://rtweb.aer.com/rrtm_frame.html and click on RRTM_LW) and
the errors at TOA, surface, and stratospheric heating rates are not
consistent with your plots.  For these calculations, LBLRTM is run for
6 streams (3 up and 3 down), and the fluxes added in quadrature.  That
sounds like one of the two approaches you used, and I’m interpreting
your statement, "I also ran off fluxes and heating rates (using my
kCARTA code) for this 605-2830 cm-1 region; since in the above plots
you see positive and negative excursions neither the TOA OLR nor the
vertical heating rates changed by any noticeable amount” to mean that
you compared a kCARTA run with your ODs to one in which you used
LBLRTM ODs.  If that is correct, then your LBLRTM-based fluxes and
heating rates wouldn’t compare well to RRTM’s, which would be
inconsistent with what we have seen in our comparisons.  If all my
assumptions are correct, my guess is that something’s wrong with your
flux calculation.  If it would help, we could send you input and
output files for an LBLRTM flux run for a profile in our test suites,
and you could run it with your set-up and see if your fluxes agree
with ours.

we want to generate spectra using LBLRTM, for gas cell tests. In other
words we only want to give a few parameters, and get LBLRTM to output
the spectra. Can you tell me how to do that? For each gas in the cell,
the gas cell parameters will be of the following form
   pressure (mb)    partial pressure (mb)     temperature (K)   amount (mol/cm2)

According to my experience, you may want to change the record 2.1
(including 2.1.1, 2.1.2, and 2.1.3) in TAPE5.

Before you change record 2.1, you should firstly change record 1.2 to the form like this:

 HI=1 F4=1 CN=5 AE=0 EM=0 SC=0 FI=0 PL=0 TS=0 AM=0 MG=1 LA=0 OD=1 XS=0   00   00

MG = 1   OD on separate files
EM = 0   no emission, od only
AM = 0 means you will provide layer averaged gas properties in record
2.1 and the LBLRTM won’t call the internal lblatm subroutine to handle
this.

After that, you need to provide the layer averaged gas properties in record 2.1.1~2.1.3

For example, you want have a cell only have two gases N2 and CO2. The
total gas pressure is 1mb and the amount ratio of N2 to CO2 is 9. You
can use the following record 2.1

record 2.1:
 1  1    7       1.0                        2.00        1.00
first “1”: IFORM, 1 means E15.7
second “1”: number of layers, here you want to use 1
third “7”: 7 major gases are specified, which are H2O, CO2, O3, N2O, CO, CH4, and O2
“1.00 and 2.00”: observational altitude and end point altitude in km

record 2.1.1:
   1.0000000E00  297.6000              1    1.00   1.500 297.60   2.00   0.500 297.60
first “1.0000000E00 ”:  gas averaged pressure
second “297.6000”: averaged temperature
third “1”: looking down merge

“1.00   1.500 297.60   2.00   0.500 297.60”: 

layer bottom altitude (km), pressure (mb), temperature (K) and layer top altitude (km), pressure (mb), temperature (K).

Note that you can set any altitude or pressure for layer boundaries since the averaged value are provided.

record 2.1.2:
   0.0000000E00   X.XXXXXXXEXX   0.0000000E00   0.0000000E00   0.0000000E00   0.0000000E00   0.0000000E00   X.XXXXXXXEXX

Gas column densities (#molecules/cm^2) for the 7 gases and for the broadening gases.

I am not sure if these LBLRTM settings are correct but you could check the LBLRTM user guide.

Ciao Sergio,

Here I attached 5 files that I use to prepare lblrtm input files
(TAPE5) and to read lblrtm output files (TAPE12 and OD_....).

wt5_new.m.
lbl_read_dbl.m
odread.m
tape7_read.m
wt5l.m

The functions have headers that I hope help you for their use.

wt5_new.m. Is a matlab function that write (LEVELS) TAPE5 file for the newest
           version of lblrtm (from v10 to the current v12.2).  As you can read in
           the function comment this script was first prepared by Dave, then I
           modified according my issues and following changes in LBLRTM.

lbl_read_dbl.m Reads double precision READIANCE/TRANSMISSION output files (TAPE12), even in
               this case the original scripts was prepared by Dave.

odread.m is similar to lbl_read_dbl.m but it reads double precision
         Optical Depth files (ODexact__).

tape7_read.m read TAPE7 file.

wt5l.m Prepares TAPE5 file for generation of Optical Depth. 
       This is the function I run to generate optical depth to be interpolated in our
       look-up-table database.  In doing this I work with the option LBLATM=0. 
 
       As you know when you set LBLATM=0 you must supply information on the atmosphere to the code. In this 
       script I load it from file atmos_data3. So you for sure cannot run this script without
       atmos_data3.mat. At moment I don't send you it since it is tuned on
       our pressure grid (If you need I send it!). But you can provide this
       information with your grid specification if you produce a TAPE7 file.

       My suggestion in order to have this TAPE7 file is: you first prepare
       TAPE5 file with wt5_new.m (set a short wavenumber range); then read
       TAPE7 with tape7_read.m and save the results in a equivalent
       "atmos_data3.mat" file; prepare TAPE5 file for OD with wt5l.m; finally
       read ODexact_ with odread.m.

Let me know if these help you and don't hesitate in contact me for further clarification.


Ciao Guido

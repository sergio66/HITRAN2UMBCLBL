To make the new distribution of files that can be read with the mexed HITRAN
reader, do the following

1) bring the HITRAN distribution from taro
cd /asl/data/hitran/HITRAN08_SERGIO/HITRAN2008/By-Molecule/Compressed-files
scp from taro *_hit08.zip

2) unzip the line-by-line files  <<<<<<<<<<<<-------------------
cd /asl/data/hitran/HITRAN08_SERGIO/Lines
unzipper     !!! run this script, which looks like

unzip ../By-Molecule/Compressed-files/01_hit08.zip
unzip ../By-Molecule/Compressed-files/02_hit08.zip
unzip ../By-Molecule/Compressed-files/03_hit08.zip
unzip ../By-Molecule/Compressed-files/04_hit08.zip
unzip ../By-Molecule/Compressed-files/05_hit08.zip
unzip ../By-Molecule/Compressed-files/06_hit08.zip
...
unzip ../By-Molecule/Compressed-files/40_hit08.zip
unzip ../By-Molecule/Compressed-files/41_hit08.zip

3) if necessary, look for updates, and unzip them eg ******
update_unzipper
** these are updates to the line by line database

4) if necessary, look for supplementals, and unzip them eg ******
supplemental_unzipper
** these are supplementals to the line by line database for gid 30,35,41,42
** which means they do not have all hot band lines, and so it might be
** better to look at the corresponding xsec equivalent which are 81,61,80,54
** respectively (see /KCARTA/DOC/gasids_H2008)

5) strip out extra characters and store into h08.by.gas
cd /asl/data/hitran
  fix08          !!!! run this script, which looks like
  fix08x         !!!! run this script, which looks like

#!/bin/sh
#
# build the local HITRAN datbase from HITRAN04 plus updates
# run in /asl/data/hitran

tr -d '\015\032' < HITRAN08_SERGIO/Lines/01_hit08.par   > h08.by.gas/g1.dat
tr -d '\015\032' < HITRAN08_SERGIO/Lines/02_hit08_f53.par   > h08.by.gas/g2.dat

tr -d '\015\032' < HITRAN08_SERGIO/Lines/07_hit08.par   > h08.by.gas/g7.dat
...
tr -d '\015\032' < HITRAN08_SERGIO/Lines/38_hit08.par   > h08.by.gas/g38.dat
tr -d '\015\032' < HITRAN08_SERGIO/Lines/39_hit08.par   > h08.by.gas/g39.dat

6) unzip the xsec files <<<<<<<<<<<<-------------------
cd /asl/data/hitran/HITRAN08_SERGIO/Xsec
unzipper      !! run this script, which looks like

unzip /asl/data/hitran/HITRAN2008/IR-XSect/Compressed-files/C2F6_IR01.zip
unzip /asl/data/hitran/HITRAN2008/IR-XSect/Compressed-files/C6H6_IR08.zip
unzip /asl/data/hitran/HITRAN2008/IR-XSect/Compressed-files/CCl4_IR00.zip
unzip /asl/data/hitran/HITRAN2008/IR-XSect/Compressed-files/CFC-113_IR00.zip
unzip /asl/data/hitran/HITRAN2008/IR-XSect/Compressed-files/CFC-114_IR00.zip

Then you need to go to eg 
/home/sergio/SPECTRA/Global_Data_HITRAN2008/
and modify codes

as well as fix a few codes in /home/sergio/SPECTRA which look for files in
  /home/sergio/SPECTRA/Global_Data_HITRAN20XY/  

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

README is Howard's main readme

Look for his data on taro:/strowdata1/taro2/s2/motteler/absdat_2007_10_06

Make sure you correctly set the start/stop wavenumbers 
                        set the inpute/output directories
in each .m file eg

  wn1 = 605; 
  wn2 = 630-15; 
  fmin = wn1;  
  topts = runXtopts_params_smart(fmin);  
  topts = runXtopts_params_smart(500);  
  dv = topts.ffin*nbox*pointsPerChunk; 

a) Produce the ODS using run8 or run8water or xsec25
b) Speed up the OD production using nodes that are freed up
c) Put together the 11 files (and 5 pressure offsets) into one big file
d) Compress the ODs
e) Output the SVD compressions into f77 binary format
f) update KCARTA/INCLUDE/kcarta.param, KCARTA/INCLUDE/pre_defined.param
g) update HT2007.param for kCARTA (using scripts in KCARTA/UTILITY and 
   KCARTA/SCRIPTS)
h) write up a new CKD database

Warning for VIS/UV
See paper by J.Orphal, K.Chance/ JQSRT v82 (2003) pgs 491-504
a) special NIR/VIS/UV xsec files, see MAKENIR4 and MAKEVIS1 and MAKEUV1
   Essentially look for lines in the usual HITRAN files, and then look for 
   lines in the xsec directories. Add together d0 + dxsec = d
   This is all taken care of in "runXtopts_mkgxsecvfiles.m"
b) O2_O2 dimer abs coeff has units of sigma = cm5/molecules2
   kCARTA uses units Q = mol/cm2. If Z = path length then 
      Q/Z Q/Z Z sigma = unitless = Q^2 /Z sigma
   (see paper by Zender, JGR v104 pg 24471 (1999)
   This is taken care of in runXtopts_savexsec.m --> calc_xsec_UV.m
     Quick sanity check : according to paper by Zender the atmospheric
     sum(Q/Z * Q/Z * Z) column (where Q = molecules/cm2 for O2 and Z is layer 
     thickness) is about 15e43 molecules^2/cm^5 while the cross 
     section at 17000 cm-1 is about 1e-45 cm^5/molecules^2. So column OD ~ 1e-2
c) for ozone in the VIS, we use Li Zhu's datafiles (stored in 
   SPECTRA/VISIBLE_OD) as this includes some very weak absorption from ozone 
   between 14000-22000 cm-1
   This taken care of in runXtopts_savexsec.m --> calc_xsec_UV_ozone_li_zhu.m
     Quick sanity check : according to paper by Orphal, at 17000 cm-1,
     the O3 cross section is about 0.5*1e-17*1e-3 cm2/molecule
     dd = load('/home/sergio/SPECTRA/IPFILES/std_g3 or std_gx3_6')
     We have total about sum(dd(:,5)) = 1.5480e-08 kilomoles/cm2
     or 9.3239e18 molcules/cm2 in the column
     So the column OD is about 0.0466 !!!!!
d) still need to worry about BrO,OClO,NO3
   eg NO3 cross section is 2e-17 cm2/molecule at 15000 cm-1
   Looks like NO3 concentration is about 1-10 ppt. So if atmospheric density
   is about 2.5e19 molecules/cm3 * (air column = 30 km = 30*10^3*10^2)
   ==> 7.5e25 molecules/cm2 of air ==> for 10 ppt there are 
   7.5e13 molecules/cm2 of NO3 ==> column OD = 7.5e13 X 2e-17 = 1.5e-3
  So for now, ignore these gases

e) Still need to worry about Rayleigh
f) cannot find SO2 UV xsec between 30000-40000 cm0-1 (this is what OMI uses!)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
A : SCRIPT CODE TO MAKE THE OPTICAL DEPTHS DATABASE (UNCOMPRESSED)

freq_boundaries.m
  set the start/stop frequency, [dv ffin] params and output directories here

runXtopts_savegas1.sc
  for an individual node you are on, this script loops through calling 
  run8water.m for each wavenumber chunk

runXtopts_savexsecX.sc
  for an individual node you are on, this script loops through calling 
  code to compute xsec absorptions for each wavenumber chunk
  This is very fast code

loop_nodes_driver.sc
  logs into the airs nodes and calls runXtopts_savegasX.m
  this starts looping through calling run8.m for the gasID,
  for each wavenumber chunk

runXtopts_savegasX.sc .... not really needed
  for an individual node you are on, this script loops through calling run8.m 
  for the gasID, for each wavenumber chunk
  So it individually performs the task of runXtops_savegasX.sc, if needed]

loop_nodes_driver_co2.sc
  Since linemixing code for some CO2 bands could be slow (eg 500-605,
  605-2830 cm-1), this gasID should be REMOVED from runXtopts_savegas1.m.
  After optical depths for all other gases hve been computed (using eg
  loop_nodes_driver.sc), this script uses all airnodes to compute ONLY 
  CO2 optical depths. 
  On each node, keeps calling runXtopts_savegas2.m. So divvy up the jobs
  carefully in this file

run_tara_g2_jmhartmann
gX_forwards_nir_runXtopts_savegasX2_jmhartmann_2010.m 
  This is to make linemixing CO2 database using Hartmann's codes

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
B : SCRIPT CODE TO ** RESTART ** COMPUTING THE OPTICAL DEPTHS

Jobs on some nodes finish faster than others (eg, some gases have very few
or no lines). As this goes on, can use the freed-up nodes to put jobs for
gasIDS which are computationally intensive

g1_backwards_nir_runXtopts_savegas1.sc
  calls g1_backwards_nir_runXtopts_savegas1.m, so it loops backwards 
  from the ending wavenumber to produce ODs for gasid 1

gX_backwards_nir_runXtopts_savegasX.sc GID
  calls gX_backwards_nir_runXtopts_savegasX.m, so it loops backwards 
  from the ending wavenumber to produce ODs for gasid GID

gX_forwards_nir_runXtopts_savegasX.sc GID VCHUNK
  calls gX_forwards_nir_runXtopts_savegasX.m, so it loops forwards 
  from the wavenumber VCHUNK to produce ODs for gasid GID

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

OTHER MISC CODE

loop_gas_done already
  calls gas_done_already(gid) to let you know how the OD computation is
  progressing for each gas

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

C,D,E : COMPRESSING THE DATABASE

Make sure you have all waveumber bdries/directories set correctly

runXtopts_mkg1vfiles.m
  puts together all the chunks/pressure offsets for water, into one file

runXtopts_mkgXvfiles.m
  puts together all the chunks for each gas, into one file

runXtopts_mkg2vfiles.m
  puts together all the chunks for CO2 (from Hartmann's codes), into one file

then go to /home/sergio/abscmp
cmprunFIRX.m
  will start compressing the optical depths. 
  
then go to /home/sergio/abscmp/fortran/mat2for
loop_mat2forFIRX.m
  will read the compressed mat files and output ieee-le f77 binary files

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

F,G : KCARTA

Go to KCARTA/UTILITY and edit compdatabase.f so that the new band info
  can be added into HT2007.param
Go to KCARTA/SCRIPTS and write/run comp_firXdatabase.sc so that the new band 
  info can be added into HT2007.param
  Add this into /home/sergio/KCARTADATA/General/compHT2007_extended0909.param
                /home/sergio/KCARTADATA/General/xsecHT2007_extended0909.param

Go to KCARTA/INCLUDE and update/run dump_kaTag_for_predefined.m
  This adds on the tag info for the new band being added
  The output needs to be put into pre_defined.param

Also updata kcarta.param* with the directory information for the 
  added band database.

Go to KCARTA/SRC and edit s_misc.f so that the new bandinfo is in kcarta
  make kcarta.x!!!

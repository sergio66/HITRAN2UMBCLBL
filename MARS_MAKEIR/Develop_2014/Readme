Hello Sergio,

Great, thanks. Will look through. In the meantime, here is my first
cut at a composite Mars atmosphere from MCD (Mars Climate DB). First 5
lines are comments -- mostly to protect against my memory :-)

The next 90 rows are for layering (km) that extend from 2 m to 250
km. Pressure (mb) is column 2, and column 3 is temperature (K). It is
unlikely that we will need this level of resolution or extent for the
layers. However, at this point, I thought it better to look at a more
careful layering especially near the surface.

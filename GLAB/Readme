copied from /home/tilak/glab

1A)   Went to /asl/data/hitran/HITRAN2012/HITRAN2012
      copied HITRAN2012.par smallHITRAN2012.par     <<< so that I can edit and dump out wavenumbers
                                                        that are not needed eg 0-555 cm-1 and 3333 - 1000000 wn
      then wrote script "rm43_47.sc" which successively sedded this file and got rid of gases 42,44, ... 47
      saving final copy in 1to42_HITRAN2012.par
      (note there were NO gases higher than g47, so did not need to get rid of g48 .. can do this and file remains same size)

1B)   Went to /asl/packages/Genln2/Hitlin
   cp hitlin08May09x.ip hitlin12Jul14.ip
     edit hitlin12Jul14.ip so I can put in H2012 info

   sergio_run_hitlin hitlin12Jul14             <<<<<< takes a while to run almost 1-2 hours!!!!!


2) can make my own copy of newglab_lite.f which has the "newest" HITRAN database 
   (by editing the file and editing LINFIL) and then 
     g77 newglab_lite.f
     mv a.out sergio_newglab_lite
   right now there is H2012

3) edited my own copy of "dogenln_onegas_sergio.m" which only uses GENERIC subdir and nothing else;
   it saves the GENLN2 output data there as a mat file, after having read the GENLN2 "lite.tau"

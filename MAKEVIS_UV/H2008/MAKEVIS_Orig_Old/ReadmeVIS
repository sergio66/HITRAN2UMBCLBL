In the MAKEVIS dir
visible_runXtopts_savegases.sc
  calls visible_runXtopts_savegases.m  which loops over gases = [1 2 3 4 5 6] 
                                       for chunk 4250
                                       It makes one file/gas/toffset
                                       eg std4250_4_pp.mat  pp = 1 : 11
                                       in dir ~/abscmp/absdat
visible_runXtopts_mkgXvfiles.m
  takes the 11 files per gas (for each chunk) and concats them into one file
  eg ~/abscmp/absdat/abs.dat has files g4v4250.mat,g5v4250.mat,g6v4250.mat



visible_runXtopts_savegas1 does the same for water (partial pressures)
visible_runXtopts_mkg1vfiles.m

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

cmprunVIS(gid) gid = 4,5,6
  makes the compressed data files 
  eg ~/abscmp/absdat/kcomp has files cg4v4250.mat,cg5v4250.mat,cg6v4250.mat

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
fortran/mat2for/mat2forVIS.m 
  converts these .mat files into .f77 files for kcarta

In the MAKEFIR7 dir

First when you know which dir you are going to be saving the mat files to, 
then run 
   mv_files_ind_gas_dirs.m
so that you create the subdirs for the individual gases g1,g2,g3 ...

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
A) Make the database with 11 toffsets. Each offsetT is stored in a
   separate file

runXtopts_savegases.sc
  calls runXtopts_savegasesX.m  which loops over gases = [2:32] 
                                      for chunk 2830:3330
                                      It makes one file/gas/toffset
                                      eg std4250_4_pp.mat  pp = 1 : 11
                                      in dir ~/abscmp/absdat

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
B) Put together all 11 Toffset files
runXtopts_mkgXvfiles.m
  takes the 11 files per gas (for each chunk) and concats them into one file
  eg ~/abscmp/absdat/abs.dat has files g4v4250.mat,g5v4250.mat,g6v4250.mat

runXtopts_savegas1 does the same for water (partial pressures)
  
runXtopts_mkg1vfiles.m
runXtopts_mkg1vfiles_backwards.m
  takes the 11 files for water (for each chunk) and concats them into one file
  eg ~/abscmp/absdat/abs.dat has files g4v4250.mat,g5v4250.mat,g6v4250.mat

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
C) Compress them
cmprunFIR7.m 
  makes the compressed data files 
  eg ~/abscmp/absdat/kcomp has files cg4v4250.mat,cg5v4250.mat,cg6v4250.mat

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
C) Turn the compressed mat files into f77 bin files 
fortran/mat2for/loop_mat2forFIR7.m 
  make sure you edit fstep, and prefix for file in fname (r,v,w whatever)
  converts these .mat files into .f77 files for kcarta

which together do the below for you automatically
  cd /home/sergio/abscmp/fortran/mat2for/
  gid = 4;
  vchunk = 4250;
  cdir = '/home/sergio/abscmp/absdat/kcomp/';
  fdir = '/home/sergio/abscmp/absdat/fbin/etc.ieee-le/';
  dtype = 'ieee-le';

or 

  gid = 1;
  vchunk = 4250;
  cdir = '/home/sergio/abscmp/absdat/kcomp.h2o/';
  fdir = '/home/sergio/abscmp/absdat/fbin/etc.ieee-le/';
  dtype = 'ieee-le';

   mat2forFIR2(gid, vchunk, cdir, fdir, dtype)
  will make /home/sergio/abscmp/absdat/fbin/etc.ieee-le/m4250_g4.dat

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
now also need to make CKD files
cd /home/sergio/SPECTRA
ckd_lookupBIN_FIR7.m

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
clean up
on /home/sergio/HITRAN2UMBCLBL
  run check_du
  and see which dirs you can blow away stuff from (after all, these are
  dirs that contains data from the 11 toffsets put into one big
       10000 x 100 x 11
  matrix!!! and can easily be regenerated

           GETTING READY FOR KCARTA

copy all your compressed data to 
  /asl/data/kcarta/H2008_otherbands.ieee-le/FIR30_50/etc.ieee-le
  /asl/data/kcarta/H2008_otherbands.ieee-le/FIR30_50/h2o.ieee-le

KCARTA/SCRIPTS
  run comp_fir5database.sc  (assumes that UTILITY/compdatabase.f is upto date!)
  then include comp_fir50_80.param into
    kCompParamFile = '/asl/data/kcarta/KCARTADATA/General/compHT2010.param'

KCARTA/INCLUDE
  need to edit kcarta.param so that you include
  c !!! h = 050_080 cm-1, at 0.00015 cm-1 spacing (= 1.5 cm-1 chunk span)
      CHARACTER*80 kWaterPathg,kCompPathg,kCKDPathg
      PARAMETER (kWaterPathg = '/asl/data/kcarta/H2008_otherbands.ieee-le/FIR30_50/h2o.ieee-le/')
      PARAMETER (kCompPathg  = '/asl/data/kcarta/H2008_otherbands.ieee-le/FIR30_50/etc.ieee-le/')
      PARAMETER (kCKDPathg   = '/asl/data/kcarta/H2008_otherbands.ieee-le/FIR30_50/etc.ieee-le/')
  edit dump_kaTag_for_predefined.m so that you have the new band
  then run it to make 
    dump_kaTag_for_predefined.param
  Put it into pre_defined.param

KCARTA/SRCv1.16
  need to edit s_misc.f, subroutine CompFileName
  type     make datafix385
  type     make

02/14/26    Make sure you dump slurm output to /dev/null eg 
              sbatch --array=1-990%256 --output='/dev/null/' sergio_matlab_chip_makegas1_103.sbatch 1,2 or 3
	      
02/10/26    Making MAKEIR/H2024
            Look at eg MAKEIR/H2024/MAKEIR_WV_H24/Readme
                     Note making g110 is a wste of time and space unlessyou are worried g1+g103 is not g110
                      MAKEIR/H2024/MAKEIR_ALL_H24/Readme	      
            since these two have detaild info how to run HITRAN2UMBCLBL
	      (for WV make 10000x100x11x5 ODs, for othes make 10000x100x11 ODs)
	    then compress into matfiles, then make f77 binary files for kCARTA

01/22/26    Added in HITRAN_REFPROFS which has reference profiles
            to make kCARTA database

11/27/21    Ready for H2020

07/16/21    Checks on sizes of array (for veryhighres) that can cause crashes

05/28/21    CIA lineshapes from JM Hartmann

03/17/21    LM CO2 code from HITRAN

08/25/18    GIESA subroutines added

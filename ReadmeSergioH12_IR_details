To make the new distribution of files that can be read with the mexed HITRAN
reader, do the following

1) bring the HITRAN distribution from taro
cd /asl/data/hitran/HITRAN08_SERGIO/HITRAN2008/By-Molecule/Compressed-files
scp from taro *_hit08.zip
[in 2012 case, they were already in HITRAN2012/HITRAN2012/HITRAN2012/By-Molecule/Compressed-files/]

2) unzip the line-by-line files  <<<<<<<<<<<<-------------------
cd /asl/data/hitran/HITRAN12_SERGIO/Lines
  unzipperHIT12  !!! run this script, which unzips newest files distributed in H12 data and looks like
    unzip ../By-Molecule/Compressed-files/01_hit12.zip
    unzip ../By-Molecule/Compressed-files/02_hit12.zip
    unzip ../By-Molecule/Compressed-files/03_hit12.zip
     ...
    unzip ../By-Molecule/Compressed-files/40_hit12.zip
    unzip ../By-Molecule/Compressed-files/41_hit12.zip
   
  unzipperHIT08  !!! run this script, which unzips older  files distributed in H12 data and looks like
    unzip ../By-Molecule/Compressed-files/04_hit08.zip
    unzip ../By-Molecule/Compressed-files/08_hit08.zip
      ....

3) if necessary, look for updates, and unzip them eg ******
update_unzipper
** these are updates to the line by line database

4) if necessary, look for supplementals, and unzip them eg ******
supplemental_unzipper
** these are supplementals to the line by line database for gid 30,35,41,42
** which means they do not have all hot band lines, and so it might be
** better to look at the corresponding xsec equivalent which are 81,61,80,54
** respectively (see /KCARTA/DOC/gasids_H2008)

5) strip out extra characters and store into h08.by.gas
cd /asl/data/hitran
  fix12          !!!! run this script, which looks like

#!/bin/sh
#
# build the local HITRAN datbase from HITRAN04 plus updates
# run in /asl/data/hitran

tr -d '\015\032' < HITRAN12_SERGIO/Lines/01_hit12.par   > h12.by.gas_allwavenumbers/g1.dat
tr -d '\015\032' < HITRAN12_SERGIO/Lines/02_hit12.par   > h12.by.gas_allwavenumbers/g2.dat
tr -d '\015\032' < HITRAN12_SERGIO/Lines/03_hit12.par   > h12.by.gas_allwavenumbers/g3.dat
tr -d '\015\032' < HITRAN12_SERGIO/Lines/04_hit12.par   > h12.by.gas_allwavenumbers/g4.dat
tr -d '\015\032' < HITRAN12_SERGIO/Lines/05_hit12.par   > h12.by.gas_allwavenumbers/g5.dat
tr -d '\015\032' < HITRAN12_SERGIO/Lines/06_hit12.par   > h12.by.gas_allwavenumbers/g6.dat
tr -d '\015\032' < HITRAN12_SERGIO/Lines/07_hit12.par   > h12.by.gas_allwavenumbers/g7.dat
...

6) unzip the xsec files <<<<<<<<<<<<-------------------
cd /asl/data/hitran/HITRAN08_SERGIO/Xsec
unzipper      !! run this script, which looks like

unzip /asl/data/hitran/HITRAN2008/IR-XSect/Compressed-files/C2F6_IR01.zip
unzip /asl/data/hitran/HITRAN2008/IR-XSect/Compressed-files/C6H6_IR08.zip
unzip /asl/data/hitran/HITRAN2008/IR-XSect/Compressed-files/CCl4_IR00.zip
unzip /asl/data/hitran/HITRAN2008/IR-XSect/Compressed-files/CFC-113_IR00.zip
unzip /asl/data/hitran/HITRAN2008/IR-XSect/Compressed-files/CFC-114_IR00.zip

Then you need to go to eg 
/home/sergio/SPECTRA/Global_Data_HITRAN2008/
and modify codes

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

README is Howard's main readme

Look for his data on taro:/strowdata1/taro2/s2/motteler/absdat_2007_10_06

Make sure you correctly set the start/stop wavenumbers 
                        set the inpute/output directories
in each .m file eg

  wn1 = 605; 
  wn2 = 630-15; 
  fmin = wn1;  
  topts = runXtopts_params_smart(fmin);  
  topts = runXtopts_params_smart(500);  
  dv = topts.ffin*nbox*pointsPerChunk; 

a) Produce the ODS using run8 or run8water or xsec25
b) Speed up the OD production using nodes that are freed up
c) Put together the 11 files (and 5 pressure offsets) into one big file
d) Compress the ODs
e) Output the SVD compressions into f77 binary format
f) update KCARTA/INCLUDE/kcarta.param, KCARTA/INCLUDE/pre_defined.param
g) update HT2007.param for kCARTA (using scripts in KCARTA/UTILITY and 
   KCARTA/SCRIPTS)
h) write up a new CKD database

Warning for VIS/UV
See paper by J.Orphal, K.Chance/ JQSRT v82 (2003) pgs 491-504
a) special NIR/VIS/UV xsec files, see MAKENIR4 and MAKEVIS1 and MAKEUV1
   Essentially look for lines in the usual HITRAN files, and then look for 
   lines in the xsec directories. Add together d0 + dxsec = d
   This is all taken care of in "runXtopts_mkgxsecvfiles.m"
b) O2_O2 dimer abs coeff has units of sigma = cm5/molecules2
   kCARTA uses units Q = mol/cm2. If Z = path length then 
      Q/Z Q/Z Z sigma = unitless = Q^2 /Z sigma
   (see paper by Zender, JGR v104 pg 24471 (1999)
   This is taken care of in runXtopts_savexsec.m --> calc_xsec_UV.m
     Quick sanity check : according to paper by Zender the atmospheric
     sum(Q/Z * Q/Z * Z) column (where Q = molecules/cm2 for O2 and Z is layer 
     thickness) is about 15e43 molecules^2/cm^5 while the cross 
     section at 17000 cm-1 is about 1e-45 cm^5/molecules^2. So column OD ~ 1e-2
c) for ozone in the VIS, we use Li Zhu's datafiles (stored in 
   SPECTRA/VISIBLE_OD) as this includes some very weak absorption from ozone 
   between 14000-22000 cm-1
   This taken care of in runXtopts_savexsec.m --> calc_xsec_UV_ozone_li_zhu.m
     Quick sanity check : according to paper by Orphal, at 17000 cm-1,
     the O3 cross section is about 0.5*1e-17*1e-3 cm2/molecule
     dd = load('/home/sergio/SPECTRA/IPFILES/std_g3 or std_gx3_6')
     We have total about sum(dd(:,5)) = 1.5480e-08 kilomoles/cm2
     or 9.3239e18 molcules/cm2 in the column
     So the column OD is about 0.0466 !!!!!
d) still need to worry about BrO,OClO,NO3
   eg NO3 cross section is 2e-17 cm2/molecule at 15000 cm-1
   Looks like NO3 concentration is about 1-10 ppt. So if atmospheric density
   is about 2.5e19 molecules/cm3 * (air column = 30 km = 30*10^3*10^2)
   ==> 7.5e25 molecules/cm2 of air ==> for 10 ppt there are 
   7.5e13 molecules/cm2 of NO3 ==> column OD = 7.5e13 X 2e-17 = 1.5e-3
  So for now, ignore these gases

e) Still need to worry about Rayleigh
f) cannot find SO2 UV xsec between 30000-40000 cm0-1 (this is what OMI uses!)

freq_boundaries_g103.m  for g103 (which is HDO = isotope 4), 605-1930 and 2405-2830 cm-1
  set the start/stop frequency, [dv ffin] params and output directories here

filelist_g1.m
  makes file list GGABCDETT where GG = gasID (1..99) ABCDE=chunk start  TT = toffset(1..11)
  so that you can run following file via cluscmd
clust_runXtopts_savegas1_file.m
  for an individual node you are on, this script loops through calling 
  run8water.m for each wavenumber chunk

filelist_g103.m
  makes file list GGABCDETT where GG = gasID (103) ABCDE=chunk start  TT = toffset(1..11)
  so that you can run following file via cluscmd
clust_runXtopts_savegas103_file.m
  for an individual node you are on, this script loops through calling 
  run8water.m for each wavenumber chunk

clust_runXtopts_savegas1_file.m
clust_runXtopts_savegas103_file.m
  same as above, but run by hand, slow as it only does one chunk (eg 605) so it has to
    loop over tt (-50,-40 ... +40,+50)
      loop over pp (0.1,0.3,1.0,3.0,10)

clust_runXtopts_savegas103_cleanupfile.m
  if some files not made by clust_runXtopts_savegas103_file.m, this is "hand" loop that goes 
  through and makes missing files

runXtopts_mkg1vfiles.m
runXtopts_mkg103vfiles.m
  after you have made all chunks, then you need to put them into huge files so that compression
  routines can be run

OTHER MISC CODE

rmerx
  if some files exist but have size 0, re-running clust* will not help out, so blow the files away

gas_done_already(gid)
loop_gas_done already
  calls gas_done_already(gid) to let you know how the OD computation is
  progressing for each gas

DON'T FORGET
  For 605-2830 and 2830-3330 cm-1 we broke up WV into (a) HDO and (b) everything but HDO
  So after doing the compression, put these into the /asl/data/KCARTADATA/H2012.hdo-ieee.le

  ***>>> And then separately run combine_g1_g103.m (which is a SUM of the two), compress
  ***>>> the sum, and put that into /asl/data/KCARTADATA/H2012.SUM_ALLISO-ieee.le

B CO2 : SCRIPT CODE TO MAKE THE CO2 gas 2 
   OPTICAL DEPTHS DATABASE (UNCOMPRESSED)

You have options of eg running
   run8co2_voigt
   run8co2_linemixUMBC
   run8co2_hartman

Can go to eg HITRAN2UMBCLBL/MAKEIR/H2012/MAKEIR_CO2_HARTMANN_H12 and run the 
  freq_boundaries.m                 note how this has "hartmann" appended at end of dirout
  filelist_g2.m                     to make the fileist driver text file
  clust_runXtopts_savegas2_file.m   clustcmd to generate the ODs
  gas_done_already.m                to see the progress
  clust_runXtopts_mkg2vfiles.m      to put things together for compression
  loop_rmerxN.m                     to remove empty files

The go to CMPRUN and run comprunIR_OTHERS, producing files in eg
  /asl/s1/sergio/H2012_RUN8_NIRDATABASE/IR_605_2830/g2.dat/linemixUMBC/kcomp
  
Note you could end up with OD = NaN esp with UMBC linemixing (oops) so in
MAKEIR_CO2_LINEMIXUMBC_H12 we have
  find_nan_put_zeros.m
which finds the NaNs in the compressed files (made after running comprunIR_OTHERS.m)
and replaces them with zeros; these compressed files are saved in eg
  /asl/s1/sergio/H2012_RUN8_NIRDATABASE/IR_605_2830/g2.dat/linemixUMBC/kcompNOZEROS

  PS if you have not done a CO2 run, don't forget to "add" on the CO2 chunks by editing 
  the info in comp_ir605_2830_H2012.param before copying it to compHT2012.param
  Add this into /asl/data/kcarta/KCARTADATA/General/compHT2012.param
                /asl/data/kcarta/KCARTADATA/General/xsecHT2012.param or junkHT2012.param

Go to KCARTA/UTILITY and edit compdatabase.f so that the new band info
  can be added into HT2012.param

Go to KCARTA/INCLUDE and update/run dump_kaTag_for_predefined.m
  This adds on the tag info for the new band being added
  The output needs to be put into pre_defined.param

Also updata kcarta.param* with the directory information for the 
  added band database.

Go to KCARTA/SRC and edit s_misc.f so that the new bandinfo is in kcarta
  make kcarta.x!!!
